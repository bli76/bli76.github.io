            The Bug Algorithm project focused on switching states from a robot following set path, and if an obstruction was detected on that path then it switched to the Wall Follower algorithm. This algorithm used scans from the lidar on top of the robot to get distance readings, and then the robot would make a decision based on those readings.
            <br> <br>
            Some basic ideas like dot product of vectors, use of trigonometric function to rotate the robot's direction, and using C++ to implement the code to the robot.
