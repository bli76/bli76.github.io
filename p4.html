        <p>
            This project was using machine learning algorithms to classify numbers. The camera on the robot was used to 
            "see" these images and then the model we trained was using the new data to see what the new data was. 
            We used a neural network because they are able to lean complex patterns in data and make predictions on these patterns.
            The image classifier does better on the MNIST data set because it is a well-known dataset for training and evaluating images, rather than 102's handwritten data.

            This is the demo or our robot. The robot's camera sees the image,
            then this image has coordinates associated with it. When it travels to this new
            destination, it uses our past path-finding algorithm.
